STEVIE - ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts   ...Tim Thompson...twitch!tjt...
=====================================

The STEVIE editor is a fairly accurate (in the small subset of commands
it chooses to implement) version of the VI editor.  It was written
at a time when alternatives (ie. VIX) were not available.  To VI users,
STEVIE should provide a much more familiar environment than VIX, but has
nowhere near the capabilities (or speed), in general.

Features/Limitations
====================

- The "." (repeat last operation) and "u" (undo last insertion or
  deletion) commands are available, and will repeat/undo almost
  anything.

- The commands implemented in STEVIE happen to be the subset of
  VI commands used by its author (suprise!).  A fair number of
  additional (positioning and substitution) commands should be
  easy to add.  Regular expressions and global substitutions
  are not implemented.

- STEVIE is limited to editing files < 64K.  The source code has no
  built-in limitations, but the file is kept in memory as a single
  contiguous stream of bytes.  This implies various limitations,
  among them the fact that operations such as insert and delete will
  slow down (by a LOT, in the current implementation) as the file
  being edited grows larger.  The slowness could be eliminated by
  some reworking, which I'm unmotiviated to do, since I rarely edit
  files larger than 16K.  Scrolling in general is also unnecessarily
  slow.  Reading/writing files is also slow.

- Known glitches/annoyances: <control-d> scrolling works strangely.
  Long (>80 chars) lines are usually handled okay, but strange
  (positional) things sometime happen at the bottom of the screen.
  Backspacing at the beginning of a line, in insert mode, isn't handled
  correctly.  Undoing insertions at the end of a line are sometimes
  off by a character.  The :r command does not work very well.
  A final line that does not end in '\n' is troublesome.

- There is some support in the editor for displaying and editing binary
  files.  Giving a '-b' option tells the editor that you are intentionally
  editing a binary file.  Unprintable characters are displayed in a
  [xxx] format, where xxx is either octal or hex (if you use the -x
  option).  The binary editing support is mostly an untested hack
  (although it was one of the original goals of the editor, so the
  support for it was not unplanned).  If it works, fine; I'm not
  claiming that it does.

- Although STEVIE has been used with no problems for several months,
  it no doubt contains bugs that will surface when used by others.
  Cautious initial use is recommended.

		operations, although there are undoubtedly some for
		which it will not.

    ?str?       Search backward for 'str'
    n           Repeat previous search
